# Issue Analysis for lovabl-ai-trader Platform

This document outlines the issues found during the analysis of the lovabl-ai-trader platform.

## Backend Issues

### 1. Missing Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file for the Python backend is missing several key dependencies. The following packages had to be installed manually:

- `bcrypt`
- `psycopg2-binary`

### 2. Database Configuration

The backend is configured to use a PostgreSQL database by default, but there are no instructions on how to set up the database. This makes it difficult for new developers to get the application running. The application was tested using a local SQLite database as a workaround.

### 3. API Routing Issues

The Flask API endpoints are not functioning as expected. When sending requests to the API, the server returns the `index.html` page instead of the expected JSON response. This is likely due to a misconfiguration in the Flask routing, where the catch-all `serve` route is overriding the API blueprints.

## Frontend Issues

### 1. Dependency Conflicts

The project has conflicting peer dependencies for `vite`. The `npm install` command fails unless the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is used. This indicates that the dependencies are not properly managed.

### 2. Import Errors

The frontend application fails to start due to an import error. The file `src/pages/Auth.tsx` attempts to import `AuthContext` from `@/contexts/AuthContext`, but this file does not exist. The `AuthProvider` is actually exported from `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`. This indicates a path resolution issue or a missing file.

## Overall Architecture

The project is a monorepo with a React frontend and a backend that is split between a Python/Flask server and a collection of Supabase serverless functions. This complex architecture is not well-documented, making it difficult to understand the data flow and the responsibilities of each component.

## Next Steps

1.  Fix the backend routing issues to ensure the API endpoints are accessible.
2.  Resolve the frontend import errors to get the application running.
3.  Create a new, simplified landing page with a better design.
4.  Deploy the new landing page.
